Hello, I am Ruxandra Matei. I have a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering and a Bachelor's Degree in Economic Informatics. I realised that a change in my career path was in order, and I'm interested in working towards a web developer career. I am currently learning Node.js and Java. Since I strive for being a full stack web developer, I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can.

Cheers! âœ¨
