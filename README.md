Hello, I am Ruxandra Matei. I have a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering and a Bachelor's Degree in Economic Informatics. I realised I did not like my job, and decided that a change in my career path was in order. I'm interested in working towards a web developer career, and I am currently learning Javascript. Since I strive for being a full stack web developer, I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can.
Cheers! âœ¨
