Hello, I am Ruxandra Matei. I have a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering and a Bachelor's Degree in Economic Informatics. I am interested in a web developer career,
and I'm currently learning Javascript. Since I strive for being a full stack web developer, I am looking forward to learning as much as I can. 

Cheers! âœ¨
